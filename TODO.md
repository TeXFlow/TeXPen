Behavior
- [ ] if you select more than 1 candidate and use upload image tab, the candidates only show if you go back to canvas tab. But actually the intended logic is that canvas and upload tab are completely independent, so going back to canvas tab should give you an independent state from upload tab, and upload tab has its own candidates bar
